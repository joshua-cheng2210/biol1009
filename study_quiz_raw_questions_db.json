Typically one will be significantly higher than the other. But, the relative concentrations of the reactants and products will cease to change. For example, if A and B are converted to C and D, and C and D are converted to A and B in the reverse reaction, then equilibrium is reached when the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is the same as the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. If the reaction of A and B to form C and D is more energetically favorable than the reaction of C and D to form A and B, equilibrium may not be reached until the concentrations of C and D are significantly higher than the concentrations of A and B. At that point, even though individual molecules of A and B may be more likely to react to form molecules of C and D, because there are so many more molecules of C and D the rate at which molecules of C and D are converted to A and B becomes the same as the rate at which molecules of A and B are converted to C and D. For example, imagine a test tube in which there are 1,000 molecules each of A and B and that 10% of them interact per minute to form C and D. That would mean that the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is 100 per minute. If the there are 10,000 molecules each of C and D in the test tube and 1% of them react per minute to form A and B, the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B would also be 100 per minute, indicating that the system is at equilibrium. If you removed some of the molecules of C and D from the test tube, right after you removed the C and D the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be unchanged, but the rate of conversion of C and D would decrease. So, the system would no longer be at equilibrium as the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be higher than the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. Because of this, the relative concentrations of A and B versus C and D would also be changing, with C and D increasing relative to A and B. Eventually, the concentrations of C and D would increase enough and the concentrations of A and B would decrease enough so that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions would become equal, meaning that equilibrium would be re-established.",

The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer.

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left.

Typically one will be significantly higher than the other. But, the relative concentrations of the reactants and products will cease to change. For example, if A and B are converted to C and D, and C and D are converted to A and B in the reverse reaction, then equilibrium is reached when the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is the same as the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. If the reaction of A and B to form C and D is more energetically favorable than the reaction of C and D to form A and B, equilibrium may not be reached until the concentrations of C and D are significantly higher than the concentrations of A and B. At that point, even though individual molecules of A and B may be more likely to react to form molecules of C and D, because there are so many more molecules of C and D the rate at which molecules of C and D are converted to A and B becomes the same as the rate at which molecules of A and B are converted to C and D. For example, imagine a test tube in which there are 1,000 molecules each of A and B and that 10% of them interact per minute to form C and D. That would mean that the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is 100 per minute. If the there are 10,000 molecules each of C and D in the test tube and 1% of them react per minute to form A and B, the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B would also be 100 per minute, indicating that the system is at equilibrium. If you removed some of the molecules of C and D from the test tube, right after you removed the C and D the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be unchanged, but the rate of conversion of C and D would decrease. So, the system would no longer be at equilibrium as the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be higher than the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. Because of this, the relative concentrations of A and B versus C and D would also be changing, with C and D increasing relative to A and B. Eventually, the concentrations of C and D would increase enough and the concentrations of A and B would decrease enough so that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions would become equal, meaning that equilibrium would be re-established.",

Remember that, because pH is the NEGATIVE log of the hydrogen ion concentration, when the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution decreases, the pH of that solution increases. So, bases cause the pH of a solution to INCREASE, rather than decrease.\n \nBases cause the concentration of H+ ions to decrease by one of two ways. Some bases reduce H+ concentrations by dissociating to form hydroxide (OH-) anions. The hydroxide ions from the bases then react with H+ in the water to form water molecules, thereby reducing H+ concentrations. Alternatively, some bases reduce H+ concentrations by accepting (binding with) hydrogen ions.\n \nSo, because the question asks which statement about bases is FALSE, the correct answer to the question is that bases cause the pH to decrease, since bases actually cause the pH to increase."

As a result, your solution will be too dilute.\nAlso, the weight of a molecule in daltons is equal to the weight of a mole of those same molecules in grams.  In other words, if a single molecule of glucose weighs 180 daltons, than a mole of glucose molecules (i.e. 6.02 X 1023 glucose molecules) will weigh 180 grams.  So, you need 180 g of glucose to have 1 mole of glucose molecules."

If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false).

Remember that, because pH is the NEGATIVE log of the hydrogen ion concentration, when the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution decreases, the pH of that solution increases. So, bases cause the pH of a solution to INCREASE, rather than decrease.\n \nBases cause the concentration of H+ ions to decrease by one of two ways. Some bases reduce H+ concentrations by dissociating to form hydroxide (OH-) anions. The hydroxide ions from the bases then react with H+ in the water to form water molecules, thereby reducing H+ concentrations. Alternatively, some bases reduce H+ concentrations by accepting (binding with) hydrogen ions.\n \nSo, because the question asks which statement about bases is FALSE, the correct answer to the question is that bases cause the pH to decrease, since bases actually cause the pH to increase."

Some bases reduce H+ concentrations by dissociating to form hydroxide (OH-) anions. The hydroxide ions from the bases then react with H+ in the water to form water molecules, thereby reducing H+ concentrations. Alternatively, some bases reduce H+ concentrations by accepting (binding with) hydrogen ions.\n \nSo, because the question asks which statement about bases is FALSE, the correct answer to the question is that bases cause the pH to decrease, since bases actually cause the pH to increase."

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right.",

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right.",

For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds.

The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer.

So, the 1 mole of MgCl2 will dissociate to form 1 mole of Mg++ and 2 moles of Cl- and the 1 mole of NaCl will dissociate to form 1 mole of Na+and 1 mole of Cl-. That means that, immediately after the solutions are added to the two sides of the tube, there will be a higher concentration of solute molecules on side A than on side B. As a result, more water molecules will be interacting with solute molecules on side A and there will therefore be a lower concentration of free water molecules on side A than on side B. That, in turn, means there will be a net flow of water molecules from side B to side A, until equilibrium is reached.",

If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false). However, if the flashlight works after you replace the batteries, that finding does not prove that your hypothesis was correct. This is because you can still come up with alternative hypotheses for why the flashlight now works. For example, you could hypothesize that the reason the flashlight wasn’t working previously was because the original batteries were inserted incorrectly. Then, when you replaced the batteries, you inserted the new batteries correctly and so fixed the flashlight. If that is the case, then your original hypothesis that the old batteries were dead would be false. The bottom line is that we can never rule out that there might be a different hypothesis that also explains all of the available experimental results and that is actually the correct hypothesis.",

For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two N=O groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two N=O groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer.",

Remember that, because pH is the NEGATIVE log of the hydrogen ion concentration, when the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution decreases, the pH of that solution increases. So, bases cause the pH of a solution to INCREASE, rather than decrease.\n \nBases cause the concentration of H+ ions to decrease by one of two ways. Some bases reduce H+ concentrations by dissociating to form hydroxide (OH-) anions. The hydroxide ions from the bases then react with H+ in the water to form water molecules, thereby reducing H+ concentrations. Alternatively, some bases reduce H+ concentrations by accepting (binding with) hydrogen ions.\n \nSo, because the question asks which statement about bases is FALSE, the correct answer to the question is that bases cause the pH to decrease, since bases actually cause the pH to increase."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two N=O groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two N=O groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers.

          "all_comments": "Good work!These two molecules have the same formula (C2N2O2H2), meaning they have the same number of atoms of the same elements, but different 3-dimensional shapes.  So, they are isomers of some sort.  Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers.  For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom.  However, the two molecules do have different structures.  Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible.  So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds.  So, in the molecule on the left, the two N=O groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two N=O groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right.  Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers.  The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer.  The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, the 1 mole of MgCl2 will dissociate to form 1 mole of Mg++ and 2 moles of Cl- and the 1 mole of NaCl will dissociate to form 1 mole of Na+and 1 mole of Cl-. That means that, immediately after the solutions are added to the two sides of the tube, there will be a higher concentration of solute molecules on side A than on side B.

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction). In addition, there is a tendency for reactions to be reversible because there is greater entropy in a mixture of substances than in a pure substance. In other words, a system that contains a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" molecules will have greater entropy than a system that has just \"A\" or just \"B\" molecules.",

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction). In addition, there is a tendency for reactions to be reversible because there is greater entropy in a mixture of substances than in a pure substance. In other words, a system that contains a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" molecules will have greater entropy than a system that has just \"A\" or just \"B\" molecules.",

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction).",

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction).",
          "all_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction.  So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B.  So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction.  However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies.  So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole.  Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous).  Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B.  If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A.  Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B.  At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction)."

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction).",

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction). In addition, there is a tendency for reactions to be reversible because there is greater entropy in a mixture of substances than in a pure substance. In other words, a system that contains a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" molecules will have greater entropy than a system that has just \"A\" or just \"B\" molecules.",

If ATP levels in the cell are high, it makes sense to slow down catabolic pathways as the cell doesn’t need to be producing more ATP at that point. As a consequence, many catabolic enzymes evolved so that they are inhibited by ATP. For a similar reason, many catabolic enzymes are activated by ADP. Conversely, because anabolic pathways require ATP and generate ADP, many of the enzymes that catalyze anabolic reactions are activated by ATP and inhibited by ADP. So, if ATP levels are high and ADP levels are low, you would expect anabolic reactions to proceed quickly.

Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules. So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on. In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going. So, once hair catches fire it will continue to burn.",

          "neutral_comments": "Remember that, although exergonic reactions are also known as “spontaneous” reactions, the fact that a reaction is “spontaneous” does not mean that it will occur quickly or even that it will occur at all. Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules. So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on. In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going. So, once a piece of wood begins to burn, it may keep on burning.",

If the activation energy barrier is 7 kcal/mol and the average free energy of the reactant molecules is only 6.9 kcal/mole, the average reactant molecule will have insufficient free energy to get over the activation energy barrier. However, we have to consider that only the AVERAGE free energy of the reactant molecules was measured, and that different reactant molecules in a solution will have slightly different free energy levels. So, some percentage of the reactant molecules will have sufficient free energy to surmount the energy activation barrier.",

Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules. So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on.

Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules. So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on.

Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules. So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on. In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going. So, once hair catches fire it will continue to burn.",

          "all_comments": "Remember that, although exergonic reactions are also known as “spontaneous” reactions, the fact that a reaction is “spontaneous” does not mean that it will occur quickly or even that it will occur at all.  Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules.  So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy.  HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”.  The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states.  So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states.  If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy.  Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on.  In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going."

So, if ATP levels are high and ADP levels are low, you would expect anabolic reactions to proceed quickly.

          "all_comments": "Nice work!Remember that, although exergonic reactions are also known as “spontaneous” reactions, the fact that a reaction is “spontaneous” does not mean that it will occur quickly or even that it will occur at all.  Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules.  So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy.  HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”.  The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states.  So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states.  If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy.  Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on.  In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going.  So, once hair catches fire it will continue to burn."

Conversely, because anabolic pathways require ATP and generate ADP, many of the enzymes that catalyze anabolic reactions are activated by ATP and inhibited by ADP. So, if ATP levels are high and ADP levels are low, you would expect anabolic reactions to proceed quickly. If you have trouble remembering the difference between catabolism and anabolism, picture a cat tearing something up to remember that catabolism is the breakdown of large, energy-rich molecules to produce smaller, less energy-rich molecules.

          "neutral_comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction).",

Remember that the rough ER gets its name from the fact that it has a “rough” appearance when looked at using a microscope.

After proteins destined for export are synthesized by ribosomes bound to the rough ER, vesicles bud off of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transport those proteins to the Golgi apparatus where they are modified. Vesicles than bud off of the Golgi apparatus and transport the proteins to the plasma membrane. The vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the proteins to the outside of the cell.",
