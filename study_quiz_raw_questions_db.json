Conversely, it is strongly recommended that you NOT wait until shortly before a quiz is due to attempt it for the first time.

          "neutral_comments": "At equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. This does not mean that the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. Typically one will be significantly higher than the other. But, the relative concentrations of the reactants and products will cease to change. For example, if A and B are converted to C and D, and C and D are converted to A and B in the reverse reaction, then equilibrium is reached when the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is the same as the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. If the reaction of A and B to form C and D is more energetically favorable than the reaction of C and D to form A and B, equilibrium may not be reached until the concentrations of C and D are significantly higher than the concentrations of A and B. At that point, even though individual molecules of A and B may be more likely to react to form molecules of C and D, because there are so many more molecules of C and D the rate at which molecules of C and D are converted to A and B becomes the same as the rate at which molecules of A and B are converted to C and D. For example, imagine a test tube in which there are 1,000 molecules each of A and B and that 10% of them interact per minute to form C and D. That would mean that the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is 100 per minute. If the there are 10,000 molecules each of C and D in the test tube and 1% of them react per minute to form A and B, the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B would also be 100 per minute, indicating that the system is at equilibrium. If you removed some of the molecules of C and D from the test tube, right after you removed the C and D the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be unchanged, but the rate of conversion of C and D would decrease. So, the system would no longer be at equilibrium as the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be higher than the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. Because of this, the relative concentrations of A and B versus C and D would also be changing, with C and D increasing relative to A and B. Eventually, the concentrations of C and D would increase enough and the concentrations of A and B would decrease enough so that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions would become equal, meaning that equilibrium would be re-established."

If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false). However, if the flashlight works after you replace the batteries, that finding does not prove that your hypothesis was correct. This is because you can still come up with alternative hypotheses for why the flashlight now works. For example, you could hypothesize that the reason the flashlight wasn’t working previously was because the original batteries were inserted incorrectly. Then, when you replaced the batteries, you inserted the new batteries correctly and so fixed the flashlight. If that is the case, then your original hypothesis that the old batteries were dead would be false. The bottom line is that we can never rule out that there might be a different hypothesis that also explains all of the available experimental results and that is actually the correct hypothesis."

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB. If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 3 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 8 different “polymers”: AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB. BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 20 monomers long, and you could use four different types of monomers, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 420 = ~ 1 x 1012"

To determine what type of isomers they represent, first look to see if the two molecules (glucose and fructose), share the same covalent partnerships. If you look at them, you will see that they do not share the same covalent partnerships. For example, the position of the carbon:oxygen double bond (C=O) is different for glucose and fructose. This means that glucose and fructose are examples of structural isomers. The other two types of isomers we studied, geometric isomers and enantiomers, do NOT differ in their covalent partnerships."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two N=O groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two N=O groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

In contrast, molecules that are geometric isomers or enantiomers do NOT differ in their covalent partnerships. Geometric isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms around a double bond. Enantiomers differ in the arrangement of atoms covalently bound to a central, asymmetric carbon and are mirror images of each other.

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB.

BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 20 monomers long, and you could use four different types of monomers, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 420 = ~ 1 x 1012"

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left.

In other words, they bind so that the 5’ end of one strand is hydrogen bonded to the 3’ end of the other strand. Also, remember that U (for RNA) or T (for DNA) hydrogen bonds with A, and G hydrogen bonds with C. So, you have: DNA 5’ AATTCGC 3’RNA 3’ UUAAGCG 5’ If you then follow the convention of writing nucleic acid molecules down starting at their 5’ end, the sequence for the RNA molecule is: 5’ GCGAAUU 3’"

In contrast, molecules that are geometric isomers or enantiomers do NOT differ in their covalent partnerships. Geometric isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms around a double bond. Enantiomers differ in the arrangement of atoms covalently bound to a central, asymmetric carbon and are mirror images of each other.

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, they are isomers of some sort. However, despite the fact that they have a carbon-carbon double bond, they are NOT geometric isomers. Geometric isomers have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms. The pair of molecules shown above do NOT have the same covalent arrangement of their atoms. For the molecule shown on the left, each of the carbon atoms is covalently bound to one hydrogen atom and one hydroxyl (OH) group. For the molecule shown on the right, one carbon atom is covalently bound to two hydroxyl groups and the other carbon atom is covalently bound to two hydrogen atoms. So, the two molecules do not have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms. Because they differ in the covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are examples of the type of isomers known structural isomers."

In contrast, fatty acids are fairly large molecules and few of them are used to make a lipid molecule. For example, just two fatty acid molecules are used in the synthesis of a typical membrane lipid molecule (e.g. a phospholipid) and just three fatty acid molecules are used to make a typical lipid molecule in fat (e.g. a triacylglycerol molecule). In addition, monomers are linked together like cars forming a train to form a polymer. In contrast, the fatty acid molecules that are used to form lipids are not joined to each other. For example, the three fatty acid molecules used to form a triacylglycerol molecule (a type of lipid molecule) are each joined separately to different parts of a glycerol molecule. So, remember that lipids are the one type of biological macromolecule we will discuss that are NOT polymers because they are NOT composed of monomers."

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB. If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 3 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), you would be able to build just 8 different “polymers”: AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB. BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 30 monomers long, and you could use two different types of monomers, “A” and “B”, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 230 = ~ 1,000,000,000"

Conversely, it is strongly recommended that you NOT wait until shortly before a quiz is due to attempt it for the first time.

Conversely, it is strongly recommended that you NOT wait until shortly before a quiz is due to attempt it for the first time. Remember, you can take each quiz up to three times with only your highest score counting, so it makes sense to take each quiz at least once a day or two before it's due so it won't matter so much if it slips your mind the day it's due."

If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false). However, if the flashlight works after you replace the batteries, that finding does not prove that your hypothesis was correct. This is because you can still come up with alternative hypotheses for why the flashlight now works. For example, you could hypothesize that the reason the flashlight wasn’t working previously was because the original batteries were inserted incorrectly. Then, when you replaced the batteries, you inserted the new batteries correctly and so fixed the flashlight. If that is the case, then your original hypothesis that the old batteries were dead would be false. The bottom line is that we can never rule out that there might be a different hypothesis that also explains all of the available experimental results and that is actually the correct hypothesis."

For example, if your hypothesis for why a flashlight isn’t working is that the batteries are dead, you might predict that replacing the batteries will fix the flashlight. If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false). However, if the flashlight works after you replace the batteries, that finding does not prove that your hypothesis was correct. This is because you can still come up with alternative hypotheses for why the flashlight now works. For example, you could hypothesize that the reason the flashlight wasn’t working previously was because the original batteries were inserted incorrectly. Then, when you replaced the batteries, you inserted the new batteries correctly and so fixed the flashlight. If that is the case, then your original hypothesis that the old batteries were dead would be false. The bottom line is that we can never rule out that there might be a different hypothesis that also explains all of the available experimental results and that is actually the correct hypothesis."

If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false). However, if the flashlight works after you replace the batteries, that finding does not prove that your hypothesis was correct. This is because you can still come up with alternative hypotheses for why the flashlight now works. For example, you could hypothesize that the reason the flashlight wasn’t working previously was because the original batteries were inserted incorrectly. Then, when you replaced the batteries, you inserted the new batteries correctly and so fixed the flashlight. If that is the case, then your original hypothesis that the old batteries were dead would be false. The bottom line is that we can never rule out that there might be a different hypothesis that also explains all of the available experimental results and that is actually the correct hypothesis."

Instead the results of tests (experiments) may only show that a particular theory or hypothesis is false. For example, if your hypothesis for why a flashlight isn’t working is that the batteries are dead, you might predict that replacing the batteries will fix the flashlight. If you then test your prediction by replacing the batteries and find that the flashlight still does not work, you have disproven your original prediction that replacing the batteries would fix the flashlight and have thus shown your hypothesis to be incorrect (false). However, if the flashlight works after you replace the batteries, that finding does not prove that your prediction was correct and thus does not prove that your hypothesis was correct. This is because you can still come up with alternative hypotheses for why the flashlight now works. For example, you could hypothesize that the reason the flashlight wasn’t working previously was because the original batteries were inserted incorrectly. Then, when you replaced the batteries, you inserted them correctly and so fixed the flashlight. If that is the case, then your original hypothesis that the old batteries were dead would be false. The bottom line is that we can never rule out that there might be a different hypothesis that also explains all of the available experimental results and that is actually the correct hypothesis."

In theory the outermost shell could also be completed by transferring 4 electrons FROM carbon to other atoms, in which case the carbon atom would have no electrons in its 2nd shell and 2 electrons in its 1st shell, which would make the 1st shell its outermost, or valence, shell and that shell would be complete since it only takes 2 electrons to fill the 1st electron shell.

You might expect that hydrogen could also fill its valence shell by transferring an electron FROM another atom, but that would leave the hydrogen with 2 electrons and only one proton which, it turns out, is energetically unfavorable."

To see this, try drawing C3H8 molecules with different structures, remembering that each molecule you draw must have 3 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms and that each carbon atom must form 4 covalent bonds and each hydrogen atom must form 1 covalent bond. You will find that you can only draw one structure. In contrast, C4H10 can form isomers. For example, the two molecules shown below are structural isomers of C4H10."

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups."

For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right."

Structural isomers have the further criteria that, for two molecules to be structural isomers of each other, they must differ in their covalent partnerships. In contrast, molecules that are geometric isomers or enantiomers do NOT differ in their covalent partnerships. Geometric isomers differ in the arrangement of atoms around a double bond. Enantiomers differ in the arrangement of atoms covalently bound to a central, asymmetric carbon and are mirror images of each other. Please see figure 4.7 in your textbook for a figure showing all three types of isomer."

For example, just two fatty acid molecules are used in the synthesis of a typical membrane lipid molecule (e.g. a phospholipid) and just three fatty acid molecules are used to make a typical lipid molecule in fat (e.g. a triacylglycerol molecule). In addition, monomers are linked together like cars forming a train to form a polymer. In contrast, the fatty acid molecules that are used to form lipids are not joined to each other. For example, the three fatty acid molecules used to form a triacylglycerol molecule (a type of lipid molecule) are each joined separately to different parts of a glycerol molecule. So, remember that lipids are the one type of biological macromolecule we will discuss that are NOT polymers because they are NOT composed of monomers."

In the case of all amino acids except glycine, those groups are: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen and an \"R\" group. The reason that glycine does not have an asymmetric carbon is because the R group of glycine is hydrogen. So, the central carbon of a glycine molecule is only bound to 3 different groups, since it is bound to two hydrogen atoms. Molecules with asymmetric carbons may occur as two different isomers, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same covalent partnerships (i.e. they do NOT differ in which elements are covalently bound to which other elements), but are instead mirror images of each other. L-methionine and D-methionine meet this definition and so are enantiomers. Please see figure 4.7 in your book for a figure illustrating the different types of isomers."

In contrast, fatty acids are fairly large molecules and few of them are used to make a lipid molecule. For example, just two fatty acid molecules are used in the synthesis of a typical membrane lipid molecule (e.g. a phospholipid) and just three fatty acid molecules are used to make a typical lipid molecule in fat (e.g. a triacylglycerol molecule). In addition, monomers are linked together like cars forming a train to form a polymer. In contrast, the fatty acid molecules that are used to form lipids are not joined to each other. For example, the three fatty acid molecules used to form a triacylglycerol molecule (a type of lipid molecule) are each joined separately to different parts of a glycerol molecule. So, remember that lipids are the one type of biological macromolecule we will discuss that are NOT polymers because they are NOT composed of monomers."

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB. If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 3 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), you would be able to build just 8 different “polymers”: AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB. BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 30 monomers long, and you could use two different types of monomers, “A” and “B”, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 230 = ~ 1,000,000,000"

In the case of all amino acids except glycine, those groups are: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen and an \"R\" group. The reason that glycine does not have an asymmetric carbon is because the R group of glycine is hydrogen. So, the central carbon of a glycine molecule is only bound to 3 different groups, since it is bound to two hydrogen atoms. Molecules with asymmetric carbons may occur as two different isomers, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same covalent partnerships (i.e. they do NOT differ in which elements are covalently bound to which other elements), but are instead mirror images of each other. L-methionine and D-methionine meet this definition and so are enantiomers. Please see figure 4.7 in your book for a figure illustrating the different types of isomers."

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB. If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 3 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 8 different “polymers”: AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB. BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 20 monomers long, and you could use four different types of monomers, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 420 = ~ 1 x 1012"

In contrast, fatty acids are fairly large molecules and few of them are used to make a lipid molecule. For example, just two fatty acid molecules are used in the synthesis of a typical membrane lipid molecule (e.g. a phospholipid) and just three fatty acid molecules are used to make a typical lipid molecule in fat (e.g. a triacylglycerol molecule). In addition, monomers are linked together like cars forming a train to form a polymer. In contrast, the fatty acid molecules that are used to form lipids are not joined to each other. For example, the three fatty acid molecules used to form a triacylglycerol molecule (a type of lipid molecule) are each joined separately to different parts of a glycerol molecule. So, remember that lipids are the one type of biological macromolecule we will discuss that are NOT polymers because they are NOT composed of monomers."

The answer is that you would need 2 water molecules, one to split the bond between the 1stand 2nd monomers and the other to hydrolyze the bond between the 2ndand 3rd monomers.

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB. If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 3 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 8 different “polymers”: AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB. BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 20 monomers long, and you could use four different types of monomers, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 420 = ~ 1 x 1012"

In other words, they bind so that the 5’ end of one strand is hydrogen bonded to the 3’ end of the other strand. Also, remember that U (for RNA) or T (for DNA) hydrogen bonds with A, and G hydrogen bonds with C. So, you have: DNA 5’ GAGGCTT 3’DNA 3’ CTCCGAA 5’ If you then follow the convention of writing nucleic acid molecules down starting at their 5’ end, the sequence for the RNA molecule is: 5’ AAGCCTC 3’"

In the case of all amino acids except glycine, those groups are: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen and an \"R\" group. The reason that glycine does not have an asymmetric carbon is because the R group of glycine is hydrogen. So, the central carbon of a glycine molecule is only bound to 3 different groups, since it is bound to two hydrogen atoms. Molecules with asymmetric carbons may occur as two different isomers, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same covalent partnerships (i.e. they do NOT differ in which elements are covalently bound to which other elements), but are instead mirror images of each other. L-methionine and D-methionine meet this definition and so are enantiomers. Please see figure 4.7 in your book for a figure illustrating the different types of isomers."

If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 2 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 4 different “polymers”: AA, AB, BA and BB. If you were asked to build a polymer that was just 3 monomers long (again, that wouldn’t be a polymer, but let’s ignore that for the moment), and had only “A” and “B” monomers available, you would be able to build just 8 different “polymers”: AAA, AAB, ABA, BAA, ABB, BAB. BBA and BBB. Are you seeing a pattern here? The answer to this type of question may be found using the following formula: Number of different polymers that may be formed = XY, where “X” is the number of different types of monomers available and “Y” is the number of monomers in the polymer. So, if you were asked to build a polymer that is 20 monomers long, and you could use four different types of monomers, the number of different polymers you could build would be: 420 = ~ 1 x 1012"
