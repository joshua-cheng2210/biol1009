## TODO (simple)
- host it on git hub pages
- recongifure what is the original page

## TODO (starting from the most important feature):
- scrape the neutral comments, which may include images, for the questions' options too
- don't clean the text of the neutral comments?
--> typical example: https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/511424/quizzes/1055567/history?version=3 (SQ topic 3 level 2 attempt 3, question 9)

quiz_title: 
SQ topic 3 level 2 (Chapter 4): BIOL 1009 (070-082) General Biology (Fall 2025)_3

- display those images onto the quiz webite too

- have a version of the question where you can properly ctrl + F 
- have a version of the question that you can display as html

- restyle the quiz page and the results page
