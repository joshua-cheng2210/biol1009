- after selecting the quiz, user will go to the quiz page and the questions will be displayed one by one. answers will be displayed right after the user chose their options. 
- improved the home page layout
- quiz questions are in study_quiz_processed_questions_db.json (there will be comments for each quiz options. and there are images for some of the questions)


- wrong quetions will be asked again in a random order in the set of remaining questions
- after all the questions are answered or the user decided to end the quiz, show some stats
- remove unnecessary code
