For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds.

Because the membrane is not permeable to sucrose, the net movement of glucose molecules from side B to side A before equilibrium is reached will cause there to be a higher concentration of solute molecules on side A than on side B. That means there will be a lower concentration of free water molecules on side A than on side B, which in turn means that there will be a net flow of water molecules from side B to side A until equilibrium is reached. At that point, there will be more than 1 l of solution on side A and therefore the sucrose concentration will have dropped to less than 2 M on side A.</p>",

So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction). In addition, there is a tendency for reactions to be reversible because there is greater entropy in a mixture of substances than in a pure substance. In other words, a system that contains a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" molecules will have greater entropy than a system that has just \"A\" or just \"B\" molecules.",

So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction).",

Exergonic, or spontaneous, reactions are defined as reactions where the free energies of the reactant molecules are higher than the free energies of the product molecules. So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on. In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going. So, once a piece of wood begins to burn, it may keep on burning.",

So, if the reaction occurs, there will be a net decrease in free energy. HOWEVER, for a reaction to occur the chemical bonds in the reactant molecules must be “stretched” into higher energy forms, so that the reactant molecules reach what is known as a “transition state”. The free energies of the reactant molecules in their transition states are higher than the free energies of the reactant molecules in their non-transition states. So, the reactant molecules may not have sufficient energy to achieve their transition states. If that is the case, the reaction will not proceed even though the overall effect of the reaction would be a decrease in free energy. Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on. In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going.",

Typically one will be significantly higher than the other. But, the relative concentrations of the reactants and products will cease to change. For example, if A and B are converted to C and D, and C and D are converted to A and B in the reverse reaction, then equilibrium is reached when the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is the same as the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. If the reaction of A and B to form C and D is more energetically favorable than the reaction of C and D to form A and B, equilibrium may not be reached until the concentrations of C and D are significantly higher than the concentrations of A and B. At that point, even though individual molecules of A and B may be more likely to react to form molecules of C and D, because there are so many more molecules of C and D the rate at which molecules of C and D are converted to A and B becomes the same as the rate at which molecules of A and B are converted to C and D. For example, imagine a test tube in which there are 1,000 molecules each of A and B and that 10% of them interact per minute to form C and D. That would mean that the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is 100 per minute. If the there are 10,000 molecules each of C and D in the test tube and 1% of them react per minute to form A and B, the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B would also be 100 per minute, indicating that the system is at equilibrium. If you removed some of the molecules of C and D from the test tube, right after you removed the C and D the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be unchanged, but the rate of conversion of C and D would decrease. So, the system would no longer be at equilibrium as the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be higher than the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. Because of this, the relative concentrations of A and B versus C and D would also be changing, with C and D increasing relative to A and B. Eventually, the concentrations of C and D would increase enough and the concentrations of A and B would decrease enough so that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions would become equal, meaning that equilibrium would be re-established.",
