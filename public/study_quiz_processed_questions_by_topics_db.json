To figure this out, realize that the fact that Tom’s parents must both be carriers means they are both heterozygous for the disease-causing allele. If we represent the disease causing allele of this gene as “d”, and the non-disease causing allele of this gene as “D”, that means Tom’s parents are both Dd. Therefore, each of the children of Tom’s parents would have an equal chance of having inherited one of the following: DD, Dd, dD or dd. Because Tom does not exhibit the disease, we can rule out dd. That means he is DD, Dd or dD. If he is Dd or dD, he is a carrier of the disease. If he is DD, he is not a carrier of the disease. Therefore there is a 2/3 chance that he is a carrier (i.e. has a “d” allele).",

For the third gene, all the offspring will inherit a copy of “c” from the first parent and all will inherit a copy of “C” from the second parent, so all the offspring will be Cc. For the 4th gene, ½ the offspring will inherit “D” and ½ will inherit “d” from the 1stparent, and ½ the offspring will inherit “D” and ½ will inherit “d” from the 2nd parent. As a result, the offspring will consist of an equal mixture of: DD, Dd, dD and dd, meaning that ¼ of the offspring will be dd. Similarly, the probability of an offspring being EE is also ¼. Because all the offspring will inherit a copy of “F” from parent 1, and all the offspring will inherit a copy of “f” from parent 2, there is a 100% probability that their offspring will be Ff.

In contrast, the long allele of the radish shape gene (S) is dominant over the oval allele. All the F1 progeny from a cross between a plant that is true breeding (homozygous) for the red allele of the flower color gene and the long allele of the radish shape gene and a plant that is homozygous for the white allele of the flower color gene and the oval allele of the radish shape gene will be heterozygous for both genes. Therefore, the cross between two F1 plants can be represented as: CcSs X CcSs. This cross will result in an equal mix of progeny that are: CC(will have red phenotype), Cc (will have purple phenotype), cC (will have purple phenotype) or cc (will have white phenotype) for the flower color gene. So, ¼ of the F2 plants will have red flowers, ½ will have purple flowers and ¼ will have white flowers. For the radish shape gene, the F2 progeny will be an equal mix of the following genotypes: SS, Ss, sS and ss. The ¾ of the F2progeny that are SS, Ss or sS will have long radishes. The ¼ of the F2 progeny that are ss will have oval radishes. Therefore, the probabilities for each phenotypic combination of flower color and radish shape are as follows:Red long: ¼ X ¾ = 3/16Red oval: ¼ X ¼ = 1/16Purple long: ½ X ¾ = 3/8 = 6/16Purple oval: ½ X ¼ = 1/8 = 2/16White long: ¼ X ¾ = 3/16White oval: ¼ X ¼ = 1/16In order of most to least common: 6/16, 3/16, 3/16, 2/16, 1/16, 1/16.

In this example, the oxygen atoms in O2 are neutrally charged (i.e. they are uncharged). The oxygen atoms in H2O have a partial negative charge because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons that form a covalent bond between an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom will spend more of their time closer to the oxygen atom, giving the oxygen atom in a water molecule a partial negative charge.

In the case of the CH4 (i.e. methane) molecule, the carbon atom in this molecule forms covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms. The bonds between the carbon atom and the hydrogen atoms are usually considered to be nonpolar, because carbon is only slightly more electronegative than hydrogen, but the fact that carbon is a bit more electronegative than hydrogen means that the electrons forming those bonds will actually spend just a bit more of their time closer to the carbon atom than to the hydrogen atom. So, the carbon atom in CH4 will be close to neutrally charged (i.e. uncharged) but, if anything, will carry a very slight negative charge. In contrast, in CO2 the covalent bonds between the carbon atom and the oxygen atoms are polar, as oxygen is significantly more electronegative than carbon. Consequently the electrons forming those bonds will spend more of their time near the oxygen atoms than near the carbon atom, leaving the carbon atom with a partial positive charge.

The oxygen atoms in H2O have a partial negative charge because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons that form the covalent bond between an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom will spend more of their time closer to the oxygen atom, giving the oxygen atom in a water molecule a partial negative charge. So, in going from O2, to H2O, the oxygen atoms go from uncharged to having a partial negative charge, so their charge is reduced. In the case of the C6H12O6 (e.g. glucose) molecule, the carbon atoms in this molecule mostly form covalent bonds to other carbon atoms, to hydrogen atoms and to hydroxyl groups (one carbon atom will also form a double bond to an oxygen atom, forming either a ketone or aldehyde group). The bonds between two carbon atoms are nonpolar. The bonds between carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms are usually considered to be nonpolar, because carbon is only slightly more electronegative than hydrogen, but the fact that carbon is a bit more electronegative than hydrogen means that the electrons forming those bonds will spend a bit more of their time closer to the carbon atom than to the hydrogen atom. Hydroxyl groups are somewhat more electronegative than carbon atoms, so the electrons forming the covalent bonds between carbon atoms and hydroxyl groups will spend a bit more of their time near the hydroxyl group. The overall effect will be for the carbon atoms in C6H12O6 to be close to neutrally charged (i.e. uncharged). In contrast, in CO2 the covalent bonds between the carbon atom and the oxygen atoms are polar, as oxygen is significantly more electronegative than carbon. Consequently the electrons forming these bonds will spend more of their time near the oxygen atoms than near the carbon atom, leaving the carbon atom with a partial positive charge. So, the carbon atoms go from being essentially uncharged in C6H12O6 to carrying a partial positive charge in CO2, meaning that the carbon atoms are oxidized during this reaction.",

The oxygen atoms in H<sub>2</sub>O have a partial negative charge because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons that form the covalent bond between an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom will spend more of their time closer to the oxygen atom, giving the oxygen atom in a water molecule a partial negative charge. So, in going from O<sub>2</sub>, to H<sub>2</sub>O, the oxygen atoms go from uncharged to having a partial negative charge, so their charge is reduced. In the case of the C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (e.g. glucose) molecule, the carbon atoms in this molecule mostly form covalent bonds to other carbon atoms, to hydrogen atoms and to hydroxyl groups (one carbon atom will also form a double bond to an oxygen atom, forming either a ketone or aldehyde group).

Instead, some of the energy released as electrons move to progressively more electronegative carriers is used to form a proton gradient. During chemiosmosis, the energy stored in this proton gradient is used to “drive” ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. Also note that, as electrons move to progressively more electronegative carriers, the energy of the electrons is DECREASING (with some of that released energy being used to form the proton gradient). Molecules in the electron transport chain aren’t really giving up some of their potential energy, as their potential energy is cycling up and down as they acquire and then donate electrons.</p>",

So, the glucose molecule is losing the electron associated with the hydrogen atom. Because hydrogen is the least electronegative of the elements we’ve discussed, when hydrogen forms a covalent bond with an atom of one of the other elements we’ve discussed, the pair of electrons forming that bond will spend more of their time nearer the atom to which the hydrogen atom is attached. When the covalent bond between the other atom and hydrogen is broken in such a way that the nucleus of the hydrogen atom and its electron are removed, the atom to which the hydrogen was attached now has sole possession of one of the two electrons that formed the covalent bond, but has completely lost any share of possession of the electron that went with the hydrogen atom. So, overall, the atom to which the hydrogen was attached has fewer electrons in close proximity after the hydrogen atom leaves than before. For example, consider a covalent bond formed between two atoms of “X”:X : XNote that the pair of electrons that forms the covalent bond (represented by the colon in this example) are equally close to each atom of X. So, the atoms are sharing these two electrons equally. So, each X atom has ½ of each of the two electrons, or the equivalent of exactly one electron from the pair.Now consider a bond between “X” and hydrogen, where “X” is more electronegative than hydrogen: X : HNote that the pair of electrons that forms the covalent bond (represented by the colon in this example) are closer to X than to the hydrogen atom. So, if each of the two electrons that form the covalent bond between X and hydrogen spend 60% of their time close to X and 40% close to the hydrogen, than that is like X having possession of 1.2 electrons and hydrogen having possession of 0.8 electrons. If the hydrogen atom leaves the XH molecule, you are left with:X .In other words, X now has possession of 1 electron from the 2 that were forming the bond between X and hydrogen. So, in terms of the bond between X and hydrogen, X went from having the equivalent of 1.2 electrons to having just one. That means X was oxidized when it lost the hydrogen atom. Because hydrogen is the least electronegative of the elements we’ve discussed, whenever a molecule loses a hydrogen atom (hydrogen ATOM, not hydrogen ION), that molecule will have been oxidized. One final point: Although hydrogen is the least electronegative element we’ve discussed, remember that covalent bonds between carbon and hydrogen are still classified as being nonpolar covalent bonds (even though they aren’t 100% nonpolar), because carbon isn’t that much more electronegative than hydrogen.",

So, NADH needs to be converted back to NAD<sup>+</sup> by a different process, namely fermentation. In fermentation, the pyruvate produced during glycolysis is converted to another molecular form, lactate (also called lactic acid) in the case of muscle cells and ethanol in the case of yeast cells (think beer!). The build up of lactic acid in your muscles is part of what causes them to become sore. Fermentation also results in NAD<sup>+</sup> being converted back to NADH.</p>",

In contrast, the substance that is (partially or entirely) “losing” an electron will have its charge increased (because electrons are negatively charged), and so is said to have been oxidized. In this example, the oxygen atoms in O2are neutrally charged (i.e. they are uncharged). The oxygen atoms in H2O have a partial negative charge because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons that form a covalent bond between an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom will spend more of their time closer to the oxygen atom, giving the oxygen atom in a water molecule a partial negative charge. So, in going from O2, to H2O, the oxygen atoms go from uncharged to having a partial negative charge, so their charge is reduced. In the case of the C6H12O6 (e.g. glucose) molecule, the carbon atoms in this molecule mostly form covalent bonds to other carbon atoms, to hydrogen atoms and to hydroxyl groups (one carbon atom will also form a double bond to an oxygen atom, forming either a ketone or aldehyde group). The bonds between two carbon atoms are nonpolar. The bonds between carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms are usually considered to be nonpolar, because carbon is only slightly more electronegative than hydrogen, but the fact that carbon is a bit more electronegative than hydrogen means that the electrons forming those bonds will spend a bit more of their time closer to the carbon atom than to the hydrogen atom. Hydroxyl groups are somewhat more electronegative than carbon atoms, so the electrons forming the covalent bonds between carbon atoms and hydroxyl groups will spend a bit more of their time near the hydroxyl group. The overall effect will be for the carbon atoms in C6H12O6 to be close to neutrally charged (i.e. uncharged). In contrast, in CO2 the covalent bonds between the carbon atom and the oxygen atoms are polar, as oxygen is significantly more electronegative than carbon. Consequently the electrons forming these bonds will spend more of their time near the oxygen atoms than near the carbon atom, leaving the carbon atom with a partial positive charge. So, the carbon atoms go from being essentially uncharged in C6H12O6 to carrying a partial positive charge in CO2, meaning that the carbon atoms are oxidized during this reaction.",

So, some of the genes that are responsible for making components of the photosynthetic machinery are located in the nuclear DNA and some are located in the chloroplast DNA.</p>",

Alternatively, hydrogen can “fill” its valence shell by transferring its one electron to another atom. You might expect that hydrogen could also fill its valence shell by transferring an electron FROM another atom, but that would leave the hydrogen with 2 electrons and only one proton which, it turns out, is energetically unfavorable.",

Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right.",

        "comments": "For a reaction to be a spontaneous reaction, the free energy of the reactant molecules must be greater than the free energy of the product molecules, so that free energy decreases as a result of the reaction. So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction). In addition, there is a tendency for reactions to be reversible because there is greater entropy in a mixture of substances than in a pure substance. In other words, a system that contains a mixture of \"A\" and \"B\" molecules will have greater entropy than a system that has just \"A\" or just \"B\" molecules.",

So, if you imagine a reaction where “A” is converted to “B”, the conversion of a molecule of A to a molecule of B will be spontaneous if the free energy of molecule A is greater than the free energy of molecule B. So, if on average A molecules have a free energy of 5 kcal/mole and B molecules have a free energy of 4.9 kcal/mole, the average free energy of a molecule of A will be greater than the average free energy of a molecule of B and therefore the conversion of an average molecule of A to an average molecule of B will represent an exergonic, or spontaneous, reaction. However, what we have to realize is that different molecules of A in a solution will have slightly different free energies and different molecules of B will have slightly free different energies. So, if the AVERAGE free energy of a molecule of B is 4.9 kcal/mole, there may be some molecules of B that have a free energy of greater than 5 kcal/mole. Those molecules of B that have a free energy that is greater than 5 kcal/mole can then be converted to molecules of A via a reaction that will be exergonic (spontaneous). Note that this does NOT mean that the conversion of B to A will occur at as high a rate as the conversion of A to B. If there are only a very small number of molecules of B that have a high enough free energy level to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction, the rate of conversion of A to B will be higher than the rate of conversion of B to A. Eventually, the high rate of conversion of A to B will result in there being enough molecules of B with sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction that the rate of conversion of B to A will equal the rate of conversion of A to B. At that point, the reaction will have reached equilibrium and both reactions will occur at the same rate (note that, in this example, at equilibrium there will be more molecules of B than of A, but a smaller percentage of the molecules of B will have sufficient free energy to be converted to A via an exergonic reaction).",

Note that adding energy to some of the reactant molecules, so that those molecules are able to undergo the reaction, will result in a release of energy that may result in more reactant molecules having sufficient energy to surmount the activation energy barrier and undergo the reaction, leading to a further release in energy that allows more reactant molecules to undergo the reaction, and so on. In other words, once a reaction gets going, it may keep going. So, once a piece of wood begins to burn, it may keep on burning. To remember the difference between exergonic and endergonic, think of free energy exiting the system during an exergonic reaction (where the free energies of the reactants are greater than those of the products) and entering the system during an endergonic reaction (where the free energies of the reactants are less than those of the products).",

Some scientists feel that if we increased the activity of telomerase in the rest of our cells, all of our cells would maintain chromosomes of approximately their original length and the negative effects of chromosome (telomere) shortening that contribute towards aging would be reduced. In fact, although this hypothesis has not yet been tested in humans, telomere extension in mice and worms has been shown to reverse some signs of aging.",

In contrast, synthesis of the other DNA strand, the “leading” strand, can occur continuously. So, the very large DNA molecules are likely to consist of leading strands.<br/> <br/><img src=\"/assessment_questions/3858986/files/3823886/download?verifier=4eedsZztznEYvEtDi3ft0VgY6w07W11ogvVDiTc6\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom;\"/></p>",

So, while the chromosomes in most of your cells will get shorter as you age, the chromosomes you pass onto your children should have their original lengths.</p>",

So, the RNA molecule will have a sequence that is complementary to the sequence of the template strand. The coding DNA strand hydrogen bonds with the template strand, meaning that the sequence of the coding strand is also complementary to the template strand. Because the RNA molecule and the coding strand are both complementary to the template strand, the nucleotide sequences of the RNA molecule and the coding strand are the same, with the exception that U is substituted for T in the RNA molecule. Probably the easiest way to figure out the answer to this question is to first realize that two of the possible answers have U’s in their sequences. Both of these answers must therefore be incorrect because DNA molecules have T rather than U. To determine which of the remaining two possible answers is the correct one, we can determine which amino acids would be specified by coding strands with the sequences shown in these two possible answers.

        "comments": "A deletion of a single nucleotide in the middle of an intron is unlikely to have a deleterious effect as introns are removed from mRNA molecules prior to translation. A deletion of 3 nucleotides in the middle of a gene will cause the mutated gene to produce a polypeptide that is missing one amino acid. Such a polypeptide may still be able to fold correctly so that it has at least close to its normal 3-dimensional shape and is able to carry out most or all of its normal functions. A single nucleotide insertion near the start of the coding sequence of a gene is more likely to be deleterious than a single nucleotide insertion near the end of the coding sequence. The reason for this is that a single nucleotide insertion will cause a frame shift mutation in the gene. A frame shift mutation causes all the codons (“words”) to be read incorrectly from the point of the mutation to the end of the gene. For example, if a particular DNA sequence has codons as follows: ATG AGG CCC TTT, inserting a G nucleotide at the beginning of the sequence would change the codons to: GAT GAG GCC CCT etc. These frame shifted codons would specify different amino acids than the non frame shifted codons, so that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide made from the part of the mutated gene following the mutation would be almost completely different than the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide made from a gene that is not mutated. If the insertion occurs further 3’ in the gene, fewer codons will be affected by the insertion. For example, if a G nucleotide is inserted after the 9th nucleotide in the DNA sequence shown above, the codons for that mutated DNA would now read: ATG AGG CCC GTT etc. So, the codons that are 5’ of the insertion site would not be affected by the insertion.",

A frame shift mutation causes all the codons (“words”) to be read incorrectly.

Inserting 1 or 4 nucleotides will also cause a frame shift mutation. In contrast, inserting 3 nucleotides will not cause a frame shift, and so the mutated gene will produce a polypeptide that is almost identical in sequence to the polypeptide produced by the unmutated gene. The polypeptide produced by this mutated gene will just have one extra amino acid and possibly, depending on exactly where the 3 nucleotides are inserted, one amino acid that is switched to a different amino acid. Such a small change in amino acid sequence may have only a small affect on the folding of the polypeptide into the correct 3-dimensional shape, and the polypeptide may still be able to carry out most or all of its normal functions.",

After that happens, the ribosome shifts position along the mRNA molecule such that the tRNA that was in the P site is now in the E site, and the tRNA that was in the A site is now in the P site. The tRNA that is now in the E (exit) site now leaves the ribosome. A new, charged tRNA enters the A site, and the whole process is repeated.</p>",

When a repressor protein is in its inactive shape, it will be unable to bind its operator sequence, and RNA polymerase will be able to transcribe the genes in that operon. Tryptophan is the corepressor for the trp repressor protein, meaning that it stabilizes trp repressor in its active form and so helps trp repressor do its job of repressing transcription of the genes in the trp operon. This makes sense if you remember that the genes of the trp operon encode polypeptides needed for synthesis of tryptophan. If a cell already has a lot of tryptophan, why would it want to make proteins whose job it is to make more tryptophan? The answer is that cells do not want to waste resources on making polypeptides for tryptophan biosynthesis if they already have plently of tryptophan. Consequently the system is set up so that tryptophan stabilizes the trp repressor protein in its active shape, so that the trp repressor protein is able to bind the trp operator and block transcription of the trp genes by RNA polymerase.Finally, remember that \"inducers\" and \"co-repressors\" are NOT named based on how they affect the repressor proteins with which they interact. Instead, they are named based on how they affect transcription of the genes in the operon they help regulate. So, \"inducers\" help increase transcription of the genes in the operon they regulate by stabilizing the repressor protein for that operon in its inactive shape. In contrast, \"co-repressors\" help decrease transcription of the genes in the operon they regulate by stabilizing the repressor protein for that operon in its active shape.",

In this model, the change in population size (dN) over time (dt) is represented by rN x (K – N)/ K. In this equation, “r” represents the rate of population growth if growth rates are unlimited by population density, and “N” represents the number of individuals in the population. So, if growth rates were unrestricted (i.e. if growth rates were exponential), dN/dt would be equal to rN. However, in this example the population growth is not un-limited, it is increasingly restricted as the size of the population nears the carrying capacity (maximum number of individuals that can be supported) of the environment. In other words, the population experiences logistic growth. The carrying capacity of the environment is symbolized by K. The effects on growth rate of the actual size of the population in relation to the carrying capacity are calculated by (K – N)/K. If the size of N is very small in comparison to K (i.e. if the area can support many, many more individuals than are currently present), then (K – N)/K will be approximately equal to K/K, or 1, and the rate of population growth will be approximately equal to rN. If the size of N is approximately the same as K (i.e. if the number of individuals already present is close to the carrying capacity), then (K – N)/K will be approximately equal to zero, and their will be little to no population growth.",

In this example, that would mean that it is safest to eat the plants. The small fish that eat the plants would have a higher concentration of the toxic substance, because each fish would need to eat about 10 pounds of plant material in order to put on one pound of weight. So, the toxins that were present in 10 pounds of plant material would end up concentrated in one pound of fish. It would be even worse to eat the large fish. To produce 1 pound of large fish takes 10 pounds of the small fish on which the large fish feed. So, 1 pound of large fish would contain the amount of toxin present in 10 pounds of small fish, or 100 pounds of plant material. Eating the very large fish would be the worst. One pound of very large fish would contain the amount of toxin present in 10 pounds of the large fish, 100 pounds of the small fish, or 1,000 pounds of the plants.",

In this model, the change in population size (dN) over time (dt) is represented by rN x (K – N)/ K. In this equation, “r” represents the rate of population growth if growth rates are unlimited by population density, and “N” represents the number of individuals in the population. So, if growth rates were unrestricted (i.e. if growth rates were exponential), dN/dtwould be equal to rN. However, in this example the population growth is not un-limited, it is increasingly restricted as the size of the population nears the carrying capacity (maximum number of individuals that can be supported) of the environment. In other words, the population experiences logistic growth. The carrying capacity of the environment is symbolized by K. The effects on growth rate of the actual size of the population in relation to the carrying capacity are calculated by (K – N)/K. If the size of N is very small in comparison to K (i.e. if the area can support many, many more individuals than are currently present), then (K – N)/K will be approximately equal to K/K, or 1, and the rate of population growth will be approximately equal to rN. If the size of N is approximately the same as K (i.e. if the number of individuals already present is close to the carrying capacity), then (K – N)/K will be approximately equal to zero, and their will be little to no population growth.",

This is an example of feedback inhibition, as a product of the catabolic pathway, namely ATP, is inhibiting enzymes that catalyze early steps in the catabolic pathway. Similarly, many anabolic enzymes evolved so that they are inhibited by ADP (and activated by ATP). So, ADP (not ATP) acts as a feedback inhibitor of anabolic pathways. If you have trouble remembering the difference between catabolism and anabolism, picture a cat tearing something up to remember that catabolism is the breakdown of large, energy-rich molecules to produce smaller, less energy-rich molecules. Anabolism is the opposite (i.e. production of large, energy-rich molecules from smaller, less complex and less energy-rich molecules).",

So, ADP (not ATP) acts as a feedback inhibitor of anabolic pathways.<br/><br/><br/> If you have trouble remembering the difference between catabolism and anabolism, picture a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">cat</span> tearing something up to remember that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">cat</span>abolism is the breakdown of large, energy-rich molecules to produce smaller, less energy-rich molecules. Anabolism is the opposite (i.e. production of large, energy-rich molecules from smaller, less complex and less energy-rich molecules).</p>",

Typically one will be significantly higher than the other. But, the relative concentrations of the reactants and products will cease to change. For example, if A and B are converted to C and D, and C and D are converted to A and B in the reverse reaction, then equilibrium is reached when the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is the same as the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. If the reaction of A and B to form C and D is more energetically favorable than the reaction of C and D to form A and B, equilibrium may not be reached until the concentrations of C and D are significantly higher than the concentrations of A and B. At that point, even though individual molecules of A and B may be more likely to react to form molecules of C and D, because there are so many more molecules of C and D the rate at which molecules of C and D are converted to A and B becomes the same as the rate at which molecules of A and B are converted to C and D. For example, imagine a test tube in which there are 1,000 molecules each of A and B and that 10% of them interact per minute to form C and D. That would mean that the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is 100 per minute. If the there are 10,000 molecules each of C and D in the test tube and 1% of them react per minute to form A and B, the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B would also be 100 per minute, indicating that the system is at equilibrium. If you removed some of the molecules of C and D from the test tube, right after you removed the C and D the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be unchanged, but the rate of conversion of C and D would decrease. So, the system would no longer be at equilibrium as the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be higher than the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. Because of this, the relative concentrations of A and B versus C and D would also be changing, with C and D increasing relative to A and B. Eventually, the concentrations of C and D would increase enough and the concentrations of A and B would decrease enough so that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions would become equal, meaning that equilibrium would be re-established.",
