To avoid missing quizzes, it is strongly recommended that you take each quiz at least once at least a day before that quiz is due. Conversely, it is strongly recommended that you NOT wait until shortly before a quiz is due to attempt it for the first time. Remember, you can take each quiz up to three times with only your highest score counting, so it makes sense to take each quiz at least once a day or two before it's due so it won't matter so much if it slips your mind the day it's due."

In theory the outermost shell could be completed by transferring 4 electrons from other atoms, but in practice this would leave the carbon atom with 4 more electrons than protons which is very unfavorable energetically. In theory the outermost shell could also be completed by transferring 4 electrons FROM carbon to other atoms, in which case the carbon atom would have no electrons in its 2nd shell and 2 electrons in its 1st shell, which would make the 1st shell its outermost, or valence, shell and that shell would be complete since it only takes 2 electrons to fill the 1st electron shell.

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right."

For the molecule shown on the right, one carbon atom is covalently bound to two hydroxyl groups and the other carbon atom is covalently bound to two hydrogen atoms. So, the two molecules do not have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms.

For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two N=O groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two N=O groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

In contrast, fatty acids are fairly large molecules and few of them are used to make a lipid molecule. For example, just two fatty acid molecules are used in the synthesis of a typical membrane lipid molecule (e.g. a phospholipid) and just three fatty acid molecules are used to make a typical lipid molecule in fat (e.g. a triacylglycerol molecule). In addition, monomers are linked together like cars forming a train to form a polymer. In contrast, the fatty acid molecules that are used to form lipids are not joined to each other. For example, the three fatty acid molecules used to form a triacylglycerol molecule (a type of lipid molecule) are each joined separately to different parts of a glycerol molecule. So, remember that lipids are the one type of biological macromolecule we will discuss that are NOT polymers because they are NOT composed of monomers."

In the case of all amino acids except glycine, those groups are: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen and an \"R\" group. The reason that glycine does not have an asymmetric carbon is because the R group of glycine is hydrogen. So, the central carbon of a glycine molecule is only bound to 3 different groups, since it is bound to two hydrogen atoms. Molecules with asymmetric carbons may occur as two different isomers, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same covalent partnerships (i.e. they do NOT differ in which elements are covalently bound to which other elements), but are instead mirror images of each other. L-methionine and D-methionine meet this definition and so are enantiomers. Please see figure 4.7 in your book for a figure illustrating the different types of isomers."

The answer is that you would need 2 water molecules, one to split the bond between the 1stand 2nd monomers and the other to hydrolyze the bond between the 2ndand 3rd monomers. So, you to completely hydrolyze a polymer takes one less water molecule than the number of monomers in the polymer."
