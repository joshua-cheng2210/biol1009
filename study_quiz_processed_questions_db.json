Remember, you can take each quiz up to three times with only your highest score counting, so it makes sense to take each quiz at least once a day or two before it's due so it won't matter so much if it slips your mind the day it's due."

In theory the outermost shell could be completed by transferring 4 electrons from other atoms, but in practice this would leave the carbon atom with 4 more electrons than protons which is very unfavorable energetically. In theory the outermost shell could also be completed by transferring 4 electrons FROM carbon to other atoms, in which case the carbon atom would have no electrons in its 2nd shell and 2 electrons in its 1st shell, which would make the 1st shell its outermost, or valence, shell and that shell would be complete since it only takes 2 electrons to fill the 1st electron shell.

In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one hydroxyl (OH) group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two hydroxyl (OH) groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two hydroxyl groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the hydroxyl groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

So, they are isomers of some sort. Because they have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms (i.e. which atoms are attached to which other atoms), they are not structural isomers. In addition, because these molecules do not have 2 carbon atoms joined by a double bond, they cannot be geometric isomers. Instead, they are “enantiomers”. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed on each other. This is quite similar to how our hands are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed on each other. For example, imagine the palms of your hands as being carbon atom and the four fingers on each hand representing covalent bonds to 4 different groups. There is no way to place one hand on the other hand so that all four of your fingers will match up. Note that enantiomers only occur in molecules that have an asymmetric carbon. For a carbon to be asymmetric, it must form covalent bonds to 4 different groups. In the molecule on the left above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the left. In the molecule on the right above, the asymmetric carbon is the carbon furthest to the right."

For the molecule shown on the right, one carbon atom is covalently bound to two hydroxyl groups and the other carbon atom is covalently bound to two hydrogen atoms. So, the two molecules do not have the same covalent arrangements of their atoms.

For example, both carbon atoms in both molecules are attached to one N=O group and one hydrogen atom. However, the two molecules do have different structures. Remember that double covalent bonds are inflexible. So, the above molecules cannot rotate around their double bonds in the way that they could if the two carbon atoms were only joined by single covalent bonds. So, in the molecule on the left, the two N=O groups will always be on the opposite sides of the double bond, whereas the two N=O groups will always be on the same side of the double bond in the molecule on the right. Molecules such as these two, which have the same covalent partnerships but different spatial arrangements, are known as geometric isomers. The molecule on the left, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on opposite sides of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a trans isomer. The molecule on the right, which has the two groups that are not hydrogen atoms (i.e. the N=O groups) on the same side of the double bond between the carbon atoms is known as a cis isomer."

In contrast, fatty acids are fairly large molecules and few of them are used to make a lipid molecule. For example, just two fatty acid molecules are used in the synthesis of a typical membrane lipid molecule (e.g. a phospholipid) and just three fatty acid molecules are used to make a typical lipid molecule in fat (e.g. a triacylglycerol molecule). In addition, monomers are linked together like cars forming a train to form a polymer. In contrast, the fatty acid molecules that are used to form lipids are not joined to each other. For example, the three fatty acid molecules used to form a triacylglycerol molecule (a type of lipid molecule) are each joined separately to different parts of a glycerol molecule. So, remember that lipids are the one type of biological macromolecule we will discuss that are NOT polymers because they are NOT composed of monomers."

In the case of all amino acids except glycine, those groups are: a carboxyl group, an amino group, a hydrogen and an \"R\" group. The reason that glycine does not have an asymmetric carbon is because the R group of glycine is hydrogen. So, the central carbon of a glycine molecule is only bound to 3 different groups, since it is bound to two hydrogen atoms. Molecules with asymmetric carbons may occur as two different isomers, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same covalent partnerships (i.e. they do NOT differ in which elements are covalently bound to which other elements), but are instead mirror images of each other. L-methionine and D-methionine meet this definition and so are enantiomers. Please see figure 4.7 in your book for a figure illustrating the different types of isomers."

The answer is that you would need 2 water molecules, one to split the bond between the 1stand 2nd monomers and the other to hydrolyze the bond between the 2ndand 3rd monomers. So, you to completely hydrolyze a polymer takes one less water molecule than the number of monomers in the polymer."

Because many of these proteins have both hydrophobic regions, which are embedded in the membrane, and hydrophilic regions, which are exposed to the aqueous environment inside or outside of the ER, they are not able to move randomly from one side of the membrane to the other after they are made. For example, if a membrane protein is synthesized such that the last part of the protein that is made is hydrophilic and is exposed on the outside of the ER membrane, that part of that protein will remain on the outside of the ER membrane and then on the outside of the vesicle that transports it to the Golgi, on the outside of the Golgi, on the outside of the vesicle that transports it the plasma membrane and then on the inside (cytoplasmic side) of the plasma membrane. It should be noted that the lipid compositions of the two halves of a lipid bilayer are not identical either, as lipid molecules very rarely flip-flop from one side of the bilayer to the other and different species of lipid molecules are synthesized in different amounts in the two halves of the bilayer."

This will continue until the system reaches equilibrium, at which point there will be an equal concentration of glucose molecules on both sides of the tube. As the system started out with 1 l of a 1 M glucose solution and 1 l of a 2 M glucose solution, at equilibrium there will be 2 l of a 1.5 M glucose solution. So, the glucose concentration on both sides of the U-tube at equilibrium will be 1.5 M. Because the membrane is not permeable to sucrose, the net movement of glucose molecules from side B to side A before equilibrium is reached will cause there to be a higher concentration of solute molecules on side A than on side B. That means there will be a lower concentration of free water molecules on side A than on side B, which in turn means that there will be a net flow of water molecules from side B to side A until equilibrium is reached. At that point, there will be more than 1 l of solution on side A and therefore the sucrose concentration will have dropped to less than 2 M on side A."

So, whether a positively charged ion would have a net flow to the outside of a cell would depend on how steep its concentration gradient is relative to how steep its electrical gradient is. The bottom line is that the net movement of an ion is down its electrochemical gradient, which takes into account both the tendency for all substances to move down their concentration gradients along with the tendency for positively charged ions to flow towards the more negatively charged side of a membrane and vice versa."

In other words, there will be a net movement of glucose molecules from side B to side A. Because the membrane is not permeable to sucrose, there will be no movement of sucrose molecules. This means that the total concentration of solute molecules (= glucose and sucrose molecules in this example) will become higher on side A than on side B. That means that more water molecules will be interacting with solute molecules on side A than on side B. This in turn means that there will be a lower concentration of free water molecules on side A than on side B. More free water molecules will thus flow through the selectively permeable membrane from side B to side A than from side A to side B.

The first group of students kept studying (reading over) the list of vocabulary words. The second group alternated between reading over the list of words and being tested on them. The third group kept being tested on the list of words. The first group of students did the worst on tests of the vocabulary words. Interestingly, the second and third groups of students did about equally well. This study suggests that repeatedly going over and over study questions is generally a more effective method of learning new material than repeatedly going over the reading (either from the textbook or from your notes). (And, going over your notes is likely to be more effective than going over the textbook)."

        "neutral_comments": "At equilibrium, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate. This does not mean that the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. Typically one will be significantly higher than the other. But, the relative concentrations of the reactants and products will cease to change. For example, if A and B are converted to C and D, and C and D are converted to A and B in the reverse reaction, then equilibrium is reached when the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is the same as the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. If the reaction of A and B to form C and D is more energetically favorable than the reaction of C and D to form A and B, equilibrium may not be reached until the concentrations of C and D are significantly higher than the concentrations of A and B. At that point, even though individual molecules of A and B may be more likely to react to form molecules of C and D, because there are so many more molecules of C and D the rate at which molecules of C and D are converted to A and B becomes the same as the rate at which molecules of A and B are converted to C and D. For example, imagine a test tube in which there are 1,000 molecules each of A and B and that 10% of them interact per minute to form C and D. That would mean that the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D is 100 per minute. If the there are 10,000 molecules each of C and D in the test tube and 1% of them react per minute to form A and B, the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B would also be 100 per minute, indicating that the system is at equilibrium. If you removed some of the molecules of C and D from the test tube, right after you removed the C and D the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be unchanged, but the rate of conversion of C and D would decrease. So, the system would no longer be at equilibrium as the rate of conversion of A and B to C and D would be higher than the rate of conversion of C and D to A and B. Because of this, the relative concentrations of A and B versus C and D would also be changing, with C and D increasing relative to A and B. Eventually, the concentrations of C and D would increase enough and the concentrations of A and B would decrease enough so that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions would become equal, meaning that equilibrium would be re-established."

So, the 1 mole of MgCl2 will dissociate to form 1 mole of Mg++ and 2 moles of Cl- and the 1 mole of NaCl will dissociate to form 1 mole of Na+ and 1 mole of Cl-. That means that, immediately after the solutions are added to the two sides of the tube, there will be a higher concentration of solute molecules on side A than on side B. Importantly, there will be a higher concentration of Cl- (which can’t pass the membrane) on side A than on side B. As a result, there will be more free water molecules on side B than on side A. So, there will be a net flow of water molecules from side B to side A, until the concentration of free water molecules is the same on both sides of the membrane. At that point, free water molecules will still cross the membrane, but the rate at which free water molecules cross from side B to side A will be equal to the rate at which free water molecules cross from side A to side B."
